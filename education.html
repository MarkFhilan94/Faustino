      <p>The picture is the School(Nabua Central Pilot School) where I spend my 6years 
        in Elementary, during that 6years was like a roller coaster ride where every 
        grade level I met new classmates and some other that are already familiar faces.
        This school was somehow part of my childhood memories where I spend 8hrs of my 
        weekdays listening to lectures, doing activities and projects but the most enjoyable   
        part was during the times when we play games.

      <p>Nabua National High School was where I spend my 4years in Junior High and 2years 
        in Senior High. Junior High was the most memorable time I had even though I belong
        to a star section in Junior High, the people in the picture was still my Friends
        where we still have a communication to one another.

      <p>Senior High was the time where I was able to meet new classmates that graduated from 
        different schools but it was also the shortest time I had studying since it is only 10 months and 
        by the end of the semester of grade 11 the pandemic started which was expected to
        last only by 2 weeks but become 2 months. So we spend grade 12 at home doing modular
        and also do an online graduation in which we are the only batch that experienced it.

      <p>How time flies so fast that I will already become a 3rd year college at Bicol 
        University, being able to attend in this University was very unexpected for me
        since I was not expecting of being able to pass the BUCESS, but after hearing
        that I passed, I convinced my parents that I want to attend in this University
        since it was only a one time chance and it was totally worth it.
